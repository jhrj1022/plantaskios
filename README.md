It's a widget application that you can add to Apple's widget system by setting your own plan and time to complete. It can help you see clearly how many seconds your plan is from the deadline, and it's shortening every minute.

At first, this software was developed for my own use. After a period of time, I found that the settings of the countdown display of the plan helped me a lot in completing the plan. So I developed it into a complete App online and continued to improve it.



The original reward model can set up a reward for each plan. Only when there is reward can there be motivation. Under the pressure of countdown and the motivation of reward, it will get twice the result with half the effort.

Speech reading function, just click, you can set the plan and the rest of the time through voice reading, very convenient.
